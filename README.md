# Portfolio

## About

This is a personal website that serves as a central hub for information about me, my projects, and my notes. The site is designed to be a clean and simple portfolio that was made with a good UX and optimized performance in mind. A Google Lighthouse audit gave it a 100 in performance on desktop, and a 96 on mobile.

## Tech Stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

* **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendering and static web applications.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
* **Notion API**: Used to fetch content for notes directly from my Notion workspace.

## Deployment

The website is deployed and hosted on **AWS Amplify**, which provides a continuous deployment pipeline from the main branch of the GitHub repository. The domain is managed using **AWS Route 53**.
